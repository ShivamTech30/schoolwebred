                    <p>All children are encouraged to pursue some Socially Useful Productive Work (SUPW) apart from their usual academic and other physical activities. These activities are conducted during hobby sessions, which are an integral part of the school curriculum. These activities provide ample opportunity to the children for developing their artistic ability, technical skills and aesthetic sense.</p>
                    <p>The activities also improve the co-ordination of the body and mind and are very important for building a sound physique, an upright and correct posture and for smart deportment, turn out and discipline.</p>

                    <p>Inter-House competitions are regularly held in various co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. These competitions give the children ample opportunity to display their skills and are conducted through activities such as House Shows (cultural programmes), Poem Recitations, Story Telling, Debates, Declamations, Quiz, Rangoli, Dancing, Group Singing, Mass PT, Orchestra etc.</p>

                    <p>Pupils are regularly sent to participate in Inter-School competitions as well.
Both the schools have an auditorium each where the children get an opportunity to go onto the stage and perform in various activities so that they may effectively learn the art of public speaking and get rid of stage-fear.</p>

                        <h4>Camps and excursions:</h4>
                        <p>Outdoor camps, treks and tours are organized every year to give the children an opportunity to see the interiors of Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal and to get some educational and recreational exposure.</p>
                        <p>These outdoor and adventure activities are important as they offer the children experiences to face the hardships and challenges of life and would also inculcate in them a spirit of adventure and love for wildlife and nature.</p>
                        <p>Camps also provide a splendid opportunity for the teachers to get to know their children better and to understand the other facets of their personality difficult to observe in the classroom.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, children also learn to communicate with each other and their teachers on a more informal level.</p>
